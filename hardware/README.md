scuznet hardware
================

Provided here solely for informational purposes is a prototype hardware design
that was built for testing the scuznet firmware. This is the second revision
of the hardware, which has the following known issues.

* A USB connection is provided but there is (as yet) no hardware support for
  it. I must have lost my mind when selecting this part, it is a PITA to
  solder. Version 2.1 of the board should replace this with something easier
  to work with.
* The power connector footprint is still too big and wiggles around while
  soldering.

This version has not received significant testing yet.
